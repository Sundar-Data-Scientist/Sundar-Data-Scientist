- 🖼️ **Image Risk Detection:** Used **LLaVA** to analyze uploaded road images for dangers (e.g., potholes).
- 🎙️ **Voice Input:** Used **Whisper** to convert questions (English/Tamil) into text; **LLaVA** answers and **gTTS** speaks it back.
- 🌐 **User Interface:** Built using **Gradio** for interactive, multilingual access.
