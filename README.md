### 🤖 Smart AI Interview System for Recruitment & Skill Assessment

I created the **Smart Interview System**, a web platform that uses AI to make hiring **faster**, **fairer**, and **more efficient**. It automates three major interview types:

- ✅ Aptitude Tests  
- 💬 Q&A Interviews  
- 🧠 HR Interviews (automated or live)

---

#### 🛠️ Tech Stack
**FastAPI**, **Bootstrap**, **YOLOv5**, **Faster R-CNN**, **TF-IDF**, **LLaMA 2 & 3.2**, **Sentence Transformers**, **Google Web Speech API**

---

#### ⚙️ Core Features

- 🎓 **Aptitude Test**  
  Uses **TF-IDF** to assess pronunciation by comparing spoken answers to the correct text.

- 💻 **Q&A Interview**  
  - Uses **Sentence Transformers** to pick questions based on job role (e.g., coding for developers).  
  - **LLaMA 2** generates both questions and expected answers.  
  - Responses are scored (0–5) using similarity with TF-IDF.

- 🧠 **HR Interview**  
  - **LLaMA 3.2** scores open-ended answers (e.g., “Why do you want this job?”) based on clarity and relevance.

- 👀 **Monitoring System**  
  - **Faster R-CNN** detects **mobile phones** using a custom 198-image dataset with data augmentation (rotation, flipping).  
  - **YOLOv5** ensures only **one person** is in frame.  
  - If **3 violations** occur, the interview is auto-terminated.

- 🗣️ **Speech Recognition**  
  Converts audio responses to text using **Google Web Speech API** for scoring.

---

#### ⚠️ Challenges Tackled

- 📷 **Small dataset for phone detection**  
  → Solved with **data augmentation** (rotation, flip, contrast).

- 🔇 **Noisy speech input**  
  → Added **30-second timer** and **silence detection** to filter garbage input.

---

#### 📊 Results

- ⏱️ Reduced hiring time
- 📈 Improved scoring fairness
- 📊 Dashboard shows average scores, job role trends, and violation reports
