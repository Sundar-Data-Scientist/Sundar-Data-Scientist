### 🤖 Smart AI Interview System for Recruitment & Skill Assessment

I created the **Smart Interview System**, a web platform that uses AI to make hiring **faster**, **fairer**, and **more efficient**. It automates three major interview types:

- ✅ Aptitude Tests  
- 💬 Q&A Interviews  
- 🧠 HR Interviews (automated or live)
---
- 🧠 **Aptitude Test:** Scored spoken answers with TF-IDF.
- 💬 **Q&A Round:** Sentence Transformers select job-relevant questions, LLaMA 2 generates QA pairs, and TF-IDF scores responses.
- 👤 **HR Interview:** LLaMA 3.2 evaluates open-ended answers on clarity and relevance.
- 🎯 **Monitoring:** YOLOv5 ensures one person; Faster R-CNN detects mobile phones. 3 violations auto-end the interview.
- 🗣️ **Speech Recognition:** Google Web Speech API converts voice to text.
- 📊 **Admin Dashboard:** Displays scores, trends, and reports.

**Tech Used:** FastAPI, Bootstrap, YOLOv5, Faster R-CNN, TF-IDF, LLaMA 2/3.2, Sentence Transformers, Google Web Speech API
